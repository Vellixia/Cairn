# Feature 003 implementation log

The recovery record for a long implementation run. Written so that a session picking this up — after
a compaction, a restart, or a week — can re-establish exactly where the work stands without
re-deriving it.

`tasks.md` is the ledger and stays authoritative for *what is done*. This file records *how it was
proved*, what moved, and what the next action is.

Implementation had not begun. Nothing was reset, cleaned, restored or force-checked-out.

### Where the work happens

A separate worktree at `.claude/worktrees/feature-003`, because the developer's checkout carries
substantial uncommitted work on `fix/daemon-cwd-and-codex-lifecycle` that must not be disturbed.
Both share one `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` (the repository's `target/`), so the 11 GB dependency cache is
reused rather than duplicated — the host has single-digit gigabytes free.

Commits are unsigned, matching the three commits already on this branch.

## Checkpoints

### Checkpoint A — Phase 1 (T001–T005): corpus scaffolding, fixtures, pre-feature baseline

| | |
|---|---|
| Tasks | T001, T002, T003, T004, T005 |
| Commit | `e5d4ff1` — pushed |
| Suite | `cargo test --workspace` — exit 0, 0 failures across every target |

**What landed**

- `tests/knowledge/` — the full corpus tree from `contracts/evaluation.md` §The corpus, 32
  directories, each with a `README.md` stating the rule its cases follow, and a root README
  recording the paired-corpus rule.
- `crates/cairn-core/src/corpus.rs` — the loader. Serde case types, a recursive walker, and a
  failure message that names the fixture file. Fixture labels (`m1`, `rs256`) are assigned UUIDs in
  **sorted label order**, so lexicographic label order and identifier order agree — which is what
  lets a fixture express `derive_subject`'s lowest-identifier tiebreak without writing a UUID by
  hand.
- `crates/cairn-core/tests/knowledge.rs` — the tier-2 target. Asserts every contract-named group
  exists with its README and every fixture in the tree parses.
- `cairn_store::migrate::run_to(pool, target)` — `run` now delegates to it. This is what lets the
  fixture stand a store up at schema 4 through the **real** migration scripts instead of
  hand-written DDL, and what makes the schema-version guard testable (T023).
- `cairn_e2e::alpha4` — the alpha.4 store fixture: migrations 1–4, then the state
  `migration.md` §What an existing store actually contains names. Fixed identifiers and timestamps,
  so a later diff attributes every difference to the migration rather than to the fixture.
- `cairn_e2e::baseline` — read/write plus `normalize`, which replaces exactly the values that differ
  between two runs (identifier, timestamp, absolute path, commit sha, sandbox project name) and
  leaves every field *name* untouched.
- `tests/knowledge/baseline/` — the pre-feature briefing subset and a 12-call Feature 001/002 MCP
  corpus, captured against the pre-feature build.
- `tests/knowledge/privacy/` — 30 seeded adversarial cases, one per class the promotion gate must
  refuse, with `generate.py` beside them so the corpus is regenerable and auditable.

**Evidence**

| Task | Proof |
|---|---|
| T001 | `cairn-core --test knowledge::every_contract_named_group_exists` |
| T002 | 8 unit tests in `corpus.rs` + the three tier-2 target tests |
| T003 | `migration_alpha4::the_fixture_stands_at_schema_four_and_carries_a_store_in_use`, `::the_fixture_is_reproducible` |
| T004 | `baseline_capture::the_committed_baseline_is_present`; capture run twice and diffed — byte-identical |
| T005 | 30 cases load; 18 `possible_secret`, 12 `project_identifying` |

**Deliberate deviations, recorded rather than silent**

1. **`corpus.rs` is a plain `pub mod`, not `#[cfg(test)]`** (T002 names the latter). Tier 2 is an
   *integration* target — `cargo test -p cairn-core --test knowledge`, as
   `contracts/evaluation.md` §Tiers documents it — and an integration target links the library as an
   ordinary dependency, where a `#[cfg(test)]` module is not visible. Gating it behind a feature
   would change the documented command. The repository already does exactly this for
   `cairnd/src/testsupport.rs`. `ci_hermeticity` will assert no product path calls it (T136).

2. **Gate check 7's operative reading**, recorded in `tests/knowledge/privacy/README.md`.
   `contracts/patterns.md` states the check as "content, *after* redaction, still matches the
   redaction pattern set", which catches what redaction missed — correct for a memory that reached
   the store through Feature 001's pipeline, where redaction already ran. Read alone it would let a
   candidate carrying a live provider key be laundered through redaction and promoted, which
   SC-315 forbids. The check is therefore
   `still_secret_shaped(content) || redact(content) != content`. The second disjunct is a no-op for
   anything that came through the normal path (redaction is idempotent and already ran), so this
   adds no behaviour for legitimate flows and makes "refuses 100% of violating candidates" hold.
   No requirement changed; no artifact needed editing.

3. **Baselines are compared normalized, not raw.** A response carries identifiers, timestamps,
   sandbox paths and commit shas that differ every run; comparing those would fail for reasons that
   have nothing to do with regression. `baseline::normalize` replaces those by shape and touches no
   field name, so a dropped or renamed field — the actual regression — still fails the comparison.

### Checkpoint B(i) — Phase 2 (T006–T017): domain types, bounds, and the pure functions

| | |
|---|---|
| Tasks | T006–T017 |
| Suite | `cargo test -p cairn-core` — 181 unit tests, 5 corpus-target tests, 0 failures |

Plan phase A. Everything here is pure data or a pure function with no I/O, testable with no
database — which is what lets the reconciliation derivation, the verification state machine and the
staleness comparison be interrogated by a JSON corpus rather than by an end-to-end run.

**What landed**

- `domain.rs` — 29 new enums plus three `OutboxEntityType` variants and the fifth `OutboxState`.
  The `text_enum!` macro gained per-variant doc comments and `Ord` (declaration order, for stable
  output only — nothing decides correctness by comparing enums).
- `knowledge.rs` — `normalize_topic_key`, `normalize_value_key`, `content_norm_digest`,
  `scope_overlap`, `normalize_relation_endpoints`, `derive_subject`. The contract's normalization
  table is the test table, verbatim.
- `verify.rs` — the total verification state machine as an explicit transition table,
  `derive_authority`, and the per-verifier fingerprint forms.
- `continuity.rs` — `classify_checkpoint` and `compare_path_fingerprint`.
- `tasks.rs` — `derive_task_state_digest`, derived progress, completion readiness, the action order
  and the criteria projection.
- `budget.rs` — `with_reserve` / `try_spend_reserved` / `release_reserve`, with the never-exceed
  property test extended to interleaved reserved and general spending.
- `config.rs` — the seventeen D75 bound fields, and `context_reserve`.
- `wire.rs` — 38 Feature 003 error codes in the existing stable set, with no `budget_exceeded`.

**Decisions taken while implementing, and why**

1. **`derive_subject` reports a mutual supersession rather than resolving it.** Step 1 of the
   contract's algorithm drops every member a `supersedes` points at. Applied literally to a cycle —
   A supersedes B and B supersedes A, which two offline machines can each decide — it drops both
   and the subject reads as `Historical`. That would let two mutually exclusive decisions annihilate
   a subject. T034 already requires the cycle to report `Conflicted`, so the derivation returns
   `Conflicted` with both members when the drop would empty an otherwise non-empty active set.

2. **`SubjectView.narrowed_by` comes from recorded `narrows` relations.** The contract's step 6 says
   "from the caller's applicable set", but the declared signature takes only members and relations.
   The durable record of a scope exception *is* the `narrows` relation (data-model §3.1), so that is
   what the derivation reads. Selection-time precedence — the project/task-fixture case — is
   `scope_overlap` plus the assembler, not this function.

3. **Reinforcement accounting is a separate field from `answers`.** A duplicate is dropped from the
   answer set but stays individually retrievable and still counts toward `distinct_origin_count`.
   Collapsing the two would lose exactly the accounting FR-406 forbids misreporting.

4. **Deviation: `unicode-normalization` added to `cairn-core`.** The plan says "No dependency is
   added". `contracts/knowledge.md` specifies Unicode NFC in all three normalizers, and without it
   `content_norm_digest` differs for two canonically equal strings — so exact-duplicate detection
   misses them and FR-326 is silently weakened. The crate was already in the workspace lockfile via
   `stringprep`; adding it produced a **one-line** lockfile change (a new edge, zero new packages),
   measured rather than assumed. The dependency the plan actually rejects is a *similarity* library,
   rejected by D46 on correctness grounds; this one is the opposite — it is what makes the digest
   deterministic. T136's hermeticity assertion must be a denylist of model/embedding/vector/graph
   clients rather than an allowlist of current dependencies, or it will trip on this.

5. **`PathFingerprint` carries an explicit `exists` flag.** The contract's three classes conflate
   "absent when the checkpoint was taken" with "excluded" and "unreadable" under `unknown`, which
   leaves `PathOutcome::Added` and `Removed` underivable — and both are in the enum the data model
   names. The flag is local-only (checkpoints never synchronize), so it costs nothing on the wire.

## Next action

Phase 3 (Local schema migration), starting at **T018**: write
`crates/cairn-store/migrations/0005_project_intelligence.sql` steps 1 and 4. Phase 3 blocks every
storage phase.

Read before starting: `migration.md` (already read) and `contracts/records-and-rebuild.md`, which
T038's rebuild procedures depend on.
